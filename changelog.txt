- well for some reason this garbage is in C# too now
- i guess its cool?
- everything is the same, for now

+ all instances of Console.ReadLine() now replaced by Utils.Input()
+ Utils.Input() optimized
+ all method names now start with capital letters
+ sleeps sleeping too short fixed
+ some unimportant variable names changed
